# Intent Classification with Feedforward Neural Network
This repository implements a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) in Python to classify intent from the NLU Benchmark dataset. The project focuses on understanding the learning process through manual implementation of key ML components without using specialised libraries.

## Key features:
-Data preprocessing: Converts text into bag-of-words representation with unknown token handling.
-Network implementation: Three-layer FFNN (input, hidden, output) with ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for output.
-Training: Implements forward propagation, backpropagation, and batch gradient descent from scratch.
-Evaluation: Predicts intent and measures model accuracy on the dataset.
-Educational focus on NumPy-based implementations, vectorisation, and understanding the mathematics behind neural network training.

## Technologies used: Python, NumPy, Pandas
